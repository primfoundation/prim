# Foundation execution handoff — September 12, 2026

## Current delivery target and recovered Mac access

The user requested a comprehensive autonomous path to 95%. [DELIVERY-95.md](DELIVERY-95.md)
defines 26 work packages over the preserved 79 requirements, seven start waves,
critical release gates, a proposed weighted outcome rubric and exact next actions.
`plan.json` owns the package mapping and requirement status; no current 75% or 95%
claim has been established. The planning change does not complete requirements.

The September 12 execution preserved and reconstructed Desktop, Primboard (both
Macs) and Browsers source snapshots privately. Foundation's current 97 files are
verified separately because its existing Git history has a missing object. Original
working trees and installed applications remain intact. The recovered private
PrimSimCore candidate and clean Desktop main build successfully; provenance is
still unresolved. Desktop's test compile fix reveals 27 legacy registry/pairing
assertion failures across 20 tests. A clean Primboard main candidate is now actually
company-signed; the existing notarization profile works and the saved submission
is in progress. Resume that submission rather than resubmitting. Sanitized receipts
are in [Mac execution evidence](evidence/2026-09-12-mac-execution.json).

Library 0.1.0a4 and SDK 0.5.0-dev.3 implement complete-pack ZIP transport. All
payload bytes, unknown files and capture receipts survive; Research with missing
or changed embedded evidence is refused. Actual Python → TypeScript → Python
archives are byte-identical after deleting originals. 110 Library tests, 100
Foundation tests, SDK checks and installed wheel/tarball checks pass locally.
See [the contract](COMPLETE-PACK-TRANSFER.md) and
[verification evidence](evidence/2026-09-12-complete-pack.json). Exact publication
state belongs to the PR and its CI runs; this evidence begins with local checks.

**Next execution:** finish Hub complete-pack open/edit/save and native integration;
resume the existing Primboard notarization and verify Gatekeeper before installation;
reconcile Desktop source provenance and legacy host failures without changing old
working trees. Continue remaining reference cases and lifecycle packages while
actual identity/review gates are resolved. No overall 95% claim is established.

Foundation PR #19 is merged at `eed0e6eae3f08352d587ff33738613bd377d98ac`, the
input main for the complete-pack increment. The original 79 requirement contracts
and all 26 delivery packages remain unchanged.

## Current state

The Foundation bootstrap (#5), ORF compatibility (#6), Library/MCP alpha (#7) and sanitized Workbook import (#10) are merged into `primfoundation/prim`. The reorganization work (#8) is merged at `cc640009089cd8663021fbd6a8211c7a605c68ea`. September 8 Hub and Primboard release work is recorded in `evidence/2026-09-08-release.json`.

Four development profiles are available through generic local creation tooling: Research, Person, Decision and Workbook. Source/workbook provenance is preserved; no customer-history import or stable-standard release is implied. All 17 workstreams, seven milestones and 79 requirement IDs remain. Whole-life contexts, diagnostics, ingestion, authority/privacy, governance, community, sustainability and the remaining diverse reference cases are still obligations.

## September 9 portable distribution increment

Library 0.1.0a2 adds installed `publish`, `resolve` and `restore` commands.
An external folder can become a data-only source without a Foundation checkout;
explicit namespace scopes, immutable source/definition pins, dependency closure,
withdrawals and a portable cache preserve offline installation and rollback.
77 Library and 97 Foundation tests pass locally, as do the SDK checks and actual
clean-wheel installed CLI/MCP smoke. The source is deleted before the restore
proof. PR #17 is merged at `fc4626fe3b597639725feff65c4cac6a3088b129`; all three CI workflows passed on `4f1122bd45cd7b86fd392450b966204d142bbc8a`. Exact source/artifact hashes and test scope are retained in
`evidence/2026-09-09-distribution.json`. See `DEFINITION-DISTRIBUTION.md` for the
runnable example, limits and remaining authenticated-publisher/identity gates.
No requirement is marked complete by these tests; the overall 75% target is
still not established by that increment. The September 11 plan now includes direct Fleet Mac execution.

## September 9 Research capture increment

Library 0.1.0a3 adds `capture-research` and `check-capture`: explicit local files
become a private native Research draft with byte-preserved originals, source
and permission provenance, and an initial capture receipt. Retry verifies the
prior operation without overwriting later edits. Complete-folder checks detect
missing or changed evidence. The current TypeScript reader preserves captured
record metadata, including exact nanosecond strings. Transfer the whole folder:
existing record-only host exporters do not migrate attachments.

96 Library tests (19 capture cases), 97 Foundation tests, existing SDK checks and
an actual installed-wheel capture/retry/folder-transfer smoke pass locally and
in all three CI workflows on PR #18 implementation head
`20ff9e3cab126e6b6af8a0f8ff8a123821184edb`. The PR retains the final ledger head
and merge identity; code evidence belongs to the exact tested source.
`evidence/2026-09-09-capture.json` retains the exact test/publication state and
`ARTIFACT-CAPTURE.md` provides the runnable example and limits. Source authority,
remote extraction, recursive media/archive parsing, revocation and independent
research/user review remain. All 79 requirements are still present.

All rows above are merged. Full tested and merge SHAs, scope and limitations are in [execution evidence](evidence/2026-09-07-execution.json). A CI result belongs to its exact tested commit, not arbitrary later work.

## September 8 shipped increment

- **Hub:** searchable discovery, readable specifications, connection onboarding, generic local creation/edit/validate/read/save/open for four pinned profiles and a downloadable offline workbench. Tests preserve unknown fields and declared Research relationships. Focused-field and stale-download-link regressions were found during hosted acceptance and fixed. The release evidence records exact artifacts, module/assets hashes, source commits, deployments and public HTTP/MCP checks.
- **Primboard:** PR #2 merged at `26fa1162c4569f2e2f87c4c4ffabc792f9aa4231`. The `PPI3` encrypted index envelope preserves an encrypted exact-byte legacy backup before migration; referenced legacy payloads authenticate with the existing key first. `prims-paste backup` and `restore … --to …` authenticate all referenced data, refuse replacement and restore to a new directory. CI `34175616470` and merged-main CI `34175780056` pass the 131-case suite, release build, isolated selftest and compatibility guards. No signed binary or private-store migration was performed here.
- **Operations:** the previous Cloudflare catalog was restored at 100%, observed live, then the current workbench version was restored and observed. A six-hour public health workflow is configured. Exact drill versions and deployments are retained; it was limited to the isolated preview.

## Next actionable gates

The subsequent Primboard increment is recorded in
[`evidence/2026-09-08-primboard-journal.json`](evidence/2026-09-08-primboard-journal.json).
PR #3 protects the working installation during candidate preparation and adds
resumable notarization tooling. PR #4 adds an authenticated encrypted multi-file
redo journal, recovery before store reads/writes, precise cleanup, path/size
checks, and deterministic derived-tab metadata. macOS CI exercises 151 scheduled
XCTest cases (including 20 journal cases and a subprocess-only helper), five real
abrupt process-exit scenarios, and 14 release-tool tests. The fixture helper and
absent optional integrations are not counted as ordinary passed tests. Exact
source, merge, CI identifiers and limitations are retained in that evidence file.

1. **Shipped portable hosts:** Foundation PR #15 and Primboard PR #5 are merged. The SDK installs outside the checkout; 83 shared cases exercise Python, TypeScript and Swift. Generic native creation/edit/export/import, operation IDs, recoverable drafts and guided locked recovery are implemented. Exact source and passing CI are in `evidence/2026-09-08-portable-delivery.json`.
2. **Hub acceptance:** PR #11 actual desktop Chromium and phone-size WebKit downloads, offline HTML and pack reopen passed, as did automated accessibility/overflow and desktop keyboard checks. PR #13 also enforces native portable-export budgets and passes real Hub ZIP-to-SDK tests, including the exact 512 KiB boundary. PR #12 adds all pinned category registry routes beside the four profiles; postmerge hosted HTTP/MCP passes. These checks supersede the earlier browser-engine download gap; they do not establish this chat's download bridge or independent real-user/assistive-technology acceptance.
3. **Compatibility follow-up:** five selected public incubator baselines retain 28 exact source blobs and 27 fixed CLI checks, including the original six OPF tests. Five cases deliberately record known unsafe acceptance. No semantic migration or arbitrary user-input safety is claimed. SDK export now checks actual formatted bytes before creating a folder, preventing an export its own reader cannot reopen. The audit retains source selection/privacy/license limits.
4. **Public operations:** current portable-export preview version `2dd0054f-5f19-4a93-9d2b-907b14a99752` has immediate rollback target `1bf1e03e-6899-4c0e-b9b9-e992a3ccc891`. Existing Free defaults remain; custom CPU limits were rejected without paid activation. Apex/www remain on Pages and production registry/login/browsers retain old Workers. Resolve ownership, cost/escalation, old clients and Railway mapping before cutover.
5. **Mac/source gates:** use `MAC-RELEASE.md` in the Primboard repository for signed installed existing-store/Keychain/TCC acceptance. September 11 Fleet execution now works; preserve dirty work and verify the discovered prim-sim candidate's source lineage/reuse authority and actual build. Preserve integration PRs and never substitute a stub. Real Apple/session/container and independent outside-user/stewardship acceptance also remain.
6. **Broader implementation:** `REMAINING-GATES.md` names available publishing, resolution, reference cases, ingestion, composition and migration work. The full project is not merely waiting for the Mac. All 79 requirements remain; no 75% claim follows from these increments.

## Stable boundaries

Private Prim instances stay local/user-owned. The public Hub distributes definitions and public metadata. Popularity has no fabricated launch signals and does not mean truth, safety or official status. Primboard and Desktop bundle/CLI/Keychain/store/signing identities remain fixed. Valid legacy browser session cookies remain compatible; restart old in-flight Apple logins when a future nonce-enforcing cutover occurs.

No production DNS or route change, repository archive/rename, history rewrite, signed release, private data upload or paid unattended worker was performed. No background agent is running. Bounded repository CI and the configured public health workflow are the only unattended checks added. `plan.json` remains the canonical ledger; regenerate `ROADMAP.md` with `python tools/program.py render` after edits.
